			  <p>The recommended way to get going with TeaRounder, is to play around with it.</p>
			  <p>You can remove individual items from your list, by adjusting amounts to zero - a box will then pop-up checking that you mean to remove the item.  You can also remove all items by tapping the "Empty list" button - a confirmation box pops-up for that too.</p>

				This is the first public version of TeaRounder.
				<ul class="alignLeft">
					<li>Built to be easy to use on any device</li>
					<li>Once the page is loaded, this "Anywhere edition" does not need internet connection to change drink list - great if you're in a bad signal area</li>
					<li>Be as specific as you want to be. Options for milk in tea like none, a drop, some milk and lots of milk; and in fizzy drinks you'll see "Pepsi" and "Coke" and "Cola". </li>
					<li>Lots of common options, plus the ability to type in custom text - supports emojii</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				TeaRounder is built to be the fastest and most efficient way to note down a drinks round list anywhere. It works even without WiFi or phone signal, once the page has loaded. You can choose from common drinks, and also type other things into the custom drink area. The custom drink area will accept any text, including emojii, except for a few symbols such as &lt; and &gt; that get ommitted.

			<button class="accordion">How the app works & how it is built</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>Apps are made from a bunch of computer files, lovingly typed and drawn by humans, in a process known as "App Development". Some of these files tell the phone what to show. Some files describe exactly how those things should look. Other files provide instructions for what should happen when someone taps or swipes on things, or are the images that make up the icons.

			  <p>So far TeaRounder is the work of one man. Phil Ganney. I live in Ipswich, in the east of England.</p>

			<div class="panel">
			  <p>The "TeaRounder" name, logo and app design are copyright Philip Ganney 2019/2020</p>
			  <p>TeaRounder and it's developers promise to never sell on any user data. TeaRounder has to comply with data protection laws applicable to the UK. Currently TeaRounder does not permanently save any user data or upload or allow sharing data - we will only do this if features require it to function correctly, and in that scenario we will take privacy and security seriously and use industry best practices.</p>
