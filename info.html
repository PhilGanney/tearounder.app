			  <p>The recommended way to get going with TeaRounder, is to play around with it.</p>
			  <p>You can remove individual items from your list, by adjusting amounts to zero - a box will then pop-up checking that you mean to remove the item.  You can also remove all items by tapping the "Empty list" button - a confirmation box pops-up for that too.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">What's new</button>
			<div class="panel">
				This is the first public version of TeaRounder.
				<ul class="alignLeft">
					<li>Built to be easy to use on any device</li>
					<li>Once the page is loaded, this "Anywhere edition" does not need internet connection to change drink list - great if you're in a bad signal area</li>
					<li>Be as specific as you want to be. Options for milk in tea like none, a drop, some milk and lots of milk; and in fizzy drinks you'll see "Pepsi" and "Coke" and "Cola". </li>
					<li>Lots of common options, plus the ability to type in custom text - supports emojii</li>
				</ul>

			<button class="accordion">What TeaRounder can do</button>
			<div class="panel">
			<p>
				TeaRounder is built to be the fastest and most efficient way to note down a drinks round list anywhere. It works even without WiFi or phone signal, once the page has loaded. You can choose from common drinks, and also type other things into the custom drink area. The custom drink area will accept any text, including emojii, except for a few symbols such as &lt; and &gt; that get ommitted.

			<button class="accordion">Coming soon</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <ul class="alignLeft">

				<li>Style options. Colours! Fonts! Rounded Corners! (a paid add on, to help toward development costs. Included in the kickstarter rewards)</li>
				<li>Add your own drinks list - will allow you to track what you've got in at the moment, and have your own menu where all of the options shown are things you have in. (Another paid add on, included in kickstarter rewards)</li>
				<li>Edit items that are already on your list (feature will just add a little bit of convenience, currently you delete them and add in what you want to replace it with, which works okay for most things)</li>
				<li>Allow you to note down who is having each drink or snack if you'd like. (Undecided if it will be free or part of kickstarter)</li>
			    <li>Allow you to save peoples tea and coffee preferences, so that next time they'd like the same drink, you won't have to ask them how they have it.(Undecided if it will be free or part of kickstarter)</li>
			    <li>Save and load up previous drink rounds - this will be handy if you regularly meet up with a group and also save peoples tea preferences.(Undecided if it will be free or part of kickstarter)</li>
				<li>Additional notes: new buttons next to each listing, tap one and a box will show up, for extra text to go into</li>
				<li>A button that lets you choose to just show options related to the kind of round you're doing - choices will be something like "Show all", "Workplace options", "Cafe options", "House options"(free update)</li>
				<li>Being able to mark foods as favourites - and if you're visiting a cafe or other food outlet that uses TeaRounder, having your favourites marked out for you</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>
			  I'm also considering getting funding for this via Patreon, giving access to an in-depth developer blog and other behind the scenes stuff in return.</p>
			  <p>Some other features, I'd like to add further down the line:</p>
			  <ul class="alignLeft">
				<li>A mug picture feature for rounds made at home or offices - so you can take pictures of mugs through the app, and then when you're doing a round, you have the option to pick a mug that the drink is going in.</li>
				<li>Search facility in the add custom drink section, with an extended list of different drinks </li>
			  </ul>

			<button class="accordion">How the app works & how it is built</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>Apps are made from a bunch of computer files, lovingly typed and drawn by humans, in a process known as "App Development". Some of these files tell the phone what to show. Some files describe exactly how those things should look. Other files provide instructions for what should happen when someone taps or swipes on things, or are the images that make up the icons.
