			  <p>The buttons at the top change which section of the menu is shown in the options directly underneath them</p>
			  <p>Then you can look through the selections underneath, to see what choices are available in that section. The price for the currently shown item is shown next to the add button. Tapping the add button adds the item to your list. The list is directly below the add button where it says "your list".</p>
			  <p>You can remove items from your list, by adjusting amounts with the minus symbol button for that row. When you change the quantity of an item to zero, a box will pop-up checking if you want to take the item off of your list.</p>
			  <p>Items are shown in the list in the order you added them, first item at the top - though if you add an item that is identical to something already in your list, the quantity for that item will increase by 1 rather than adding another line to your list.</p>

			<button class="accordion">What TeaRounder works on, and where</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>TeaRounder.app has been designed and tested to look great on any smartphone, tablet or laptop from the last 5 years; with controls that are easy to use whether your using a touch screen or a mouse.</p>
				<p>It is now installable on most modern devices. Some browsers (inc: Chrome and Edge) will show install buttons for the app, next to their web address box. We're working on a regular install button on the page.</p>

			<button class="accordion">How TeaRounder works & how it is built</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>Websites and apps are made from a bunch of computer files, lovingly typed and drawn by humans, in a process known as "Software Development". Some of these files tell the device what to show. Some files describe exactly how those things should look. Other files provide instructions for what should happen when someone taps or swipes on things, or are the images that make up the icons. 
			  </p>
			  <p>Like many websites and apps, TeaRounder uses HTML files (.html) for general layouts, CSS files (.css) to set how things are styled and JavaScript files (.js) to give instructions for what happens in the web browser when users click or tap something. The computers that hold the website at tearounder.app and take any info that is uploaded to them (like orders that have been placed) are set to follow some other files, to make sure food and drink orders are uploaded properly and available to the screen used by service staff.</p>
			  <p>TeaRounder is created and regularly updated with improvements by Phil Ganney. The computers that hold all the files at tearounder.app and the internet connection that makes sure it's available all the time, are looked after by a hosting company with over 20 years of experience.</p>
