				<h2>What is TeaRounder?</h2>
				<p>TeaRounder is a web based app primarily for phones, for ordering food and drink easily.</p>
				<p>I designed TeaRounder with fast, convenient use in mind. The main selling point is that it gives your phone using customers a way to order, and reorder, in a really convenient way, where they don't have to physically queue and they don't need to wait for staff to come and take their order. </p>
				<h2>How much does it cost usually? What is included?</h2>
				<p>TeaRounder has a free tier that is self-service and can't do customer payment, plus 2 paid tiers: the Advanced Support package that is £30 per month at full price, and a Premium Package that is £60 per month at full price. The advanced support package adds support and setup help via video call or phone, and if you want, we can add all your menu choices into TeaRounder for you (just send us pictures or files with your menu, or even read the menu to us over a call). The Premium Package includes all of the advanced support package plus an eCommerce website (powered by WooCommerce) specifically for your business, that we connect to TeaRounder to allow payments.</p>
				<p>TeaRounder is free for end customers, and we don't take any commission or payment fees (though payment processors do)</p>
				<h2>What discounts/offers are available?</h2>
				<p><i>(Last updated 17th August 2022)</i></p>
				<p>Annual payment: 12 months worth for the price of 10 when you pay for them up front.</p>
				<p>"Business card code - offer of the month": if Phil has given you a business card, it will have a discount code that will entitle you to an offer of the month for the month when you activate it.</p><p>August 2022: get 6 months of the advanced support package for free <i>(offer ends 31st August 2022)</i></p>

					<p>I'm making a version of TeaRounder, that is customizable to the needs of food venues.</p>
					<p>To make sure it fits needs well, I want to talk to people with some experience of running a food business or want to use a system like this at some point. (Wether you have a currently open business or not.) </p>
					<p>You can talk to me directly via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">LinkedIn</a>
					</p>
					<p>You can also just sign up for a free trial when it's ready, via the button below. We have a special early offer for the first 20 people to sign up.  
					<br/>We're starting simple, and continuously building onto the product, based on customer requests and needs. The simpler your needs are, the sooner we'll have you covered.</p>
					<p> We only require an email address and choice of what emails you want to recieve. If you choose to provide a link to your menu, we'll set up a demo with it asap.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="eatinPagesEarlyOfferingDiv" class="hidden eatinMoreInfo">
					<h2>We're offering our first 20 customers:</h2>
					<p>free set up (give us a copy of your menu, and we'll take care of the rest)
						<br/>free support directly with the creator/founder of TeaRounder, via email or video call.
						<br/>free trial (no card details necessary & no contract to sign)
						<br/> - lasts for at least one month, from when your first customer order is placed. (We'll never charge for pages that aren't in use!)
						<br/> - after first month: Only start paying, when you next change your menu (items, prices or colour scheme). Basic package £10 per month or £100 for a year up front. More features for £35 per month, or £300 for a year up front. (special prices just for our first 20 customers, pricing for everyone else is TBD)
						<br/>Tell us any dream features, and we'll see what we can do about adding them for you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="eatinPagesCurrentFeaturesDiv" class="hidden eatinMoreInfo">
					<h2>Continuous improvement</h2>
					<p>
						We're starting simple, and adding at least one requested feature every 1-2 weeks.
						<br/>This lets us launch more quickly than we otherwise would, and we'll be closely fitting to our customers' needs.
						<br/>More features will mean more customers for us, so that's strong motivation to add them quickly!
					</p>
					<p>We'll be releasing a simple demo soon.
						<br/>We provide a great opportunity to tell us about features you want, in an optional section in our sign up form. You can also just email us or tell me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">linkedin</a> anytime inspiration strikes!
					</p>
					<p>This is custom software, with the creator directly listening to customers, making sure that each customer has a system that fits their needs perfectly.
