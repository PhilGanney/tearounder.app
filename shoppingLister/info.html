			  <p>I realised that TeaRounder Anywhere is actually pretty handy for any kind of list. It just needs different options at the top and a few other little tweaks for each type of list.</p>
			  <p>So for fun, and because I know I'll use it with minimal amount of changes, I've copied all my code for TeaRounder anywhere into a new folder and am making edits to turn it into a shopping list webapp.</p>

			<button class="accordion">Getting started</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>The recommended way to get going with this, is to play around with it.</p>
			  <p>You can remove individual items from your list, by adjusting amounts to zero - a box will then pop-up checking that you mean to remove the item.  You can also remove all items by tapping the "Empty list" button - a confirmation box pops-up for that too.</p>

			  <p>So far ShoppingLister and TeaRounder are the work of one man. Phil Ganney. I live in Ipswich, in the east of England.</p>
			  <p>I currently fund myself via contracting/consulting for other web businesses. If you like what you see and want to work with me, and can pay me Â£15 per hour <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">message me on linked in!</a></p>

			<div class="panel">
			  <p>The "TeaRounder" name, logo and app design are copyright Philip Ganney 2019/2020</p>
			  <p>TeaRounder and it's developers promise to never sell on any user data. TeaRounder has to comply with data protection laws applicable to the UK. Currently TeaRounder does not permanently save any user data or upload or allow sharing data - we will only do this if features require it to function correctly, and in that scenario we will take privacy and security seriously and use industry best practices.</p>
