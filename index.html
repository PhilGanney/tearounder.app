					<p>I'm making a version of TeaRounder, that is customizable to the needs of food venues.</p>
					<p>To make sure it fits needs well, I want to talk to people with some experience of running a food business or want to use a system like this at some point. (Wether you have a currently open business or not.) </p>
					<p>You can talk to me directly via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">LinkedIn</a>
					</p>
					<p>You can also just sign up for a free trial when it's ready, via the button below. We have a special early offer for the first 20 people to sign up.  
					<br/>We're starting simple, and continuously building onto the product, based on customer requests and needs. The simpler your needs are, the sooner we'll have you covered.</p>
					<p> We only require an email address and choice of what emails you want to recieve. If you choose to provide a link to your menu, we'll set up a demo with it asap.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="eatinPagesEarlyOfferingDiv" class="hidden eatinMoreInfo">
					<h2>We're offering our first 20 customers:</h2>
					<p>free set up (give us a copy of your menu, and we'll take care of the rest)
						<br/>free support directly with the creator/founder of TeaRounder, via email or video call.
						<br/>free trial (no card details necessary & no contract to sign)
						<br/> - lasts for at least one month, from when your first customer order is placed. (We'll never charge for pages that aren't in use!)
						<br/> - after first month: Only start paying, when you next change your menu (items, prices or colour scheme). Basic package £10 per month or £100 for a year up front. More features for £35 per month, or £300 for a year up front. (special prices just for our first 20 customers, pricing for everyone else is TBD)
						<br/>Tell us any dream features, and we'll see what we can do about adding them for you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="eatinPagesCurrentFeaturesDiv" class="hidden eatinMoreInfo">
					<h2>Continuous improvement</h2>
					<p>
						We're starting simple, and adding at least one requested feature every 1-2 weeks.
						<br/>This lets us launch more quickly than we otherwise would, and we'll be closely fitting to our customers' needs.
						<br/>More features will mean more customers for us, so that's strong motivation to add them quickly!
					</p>
					<p>We'll be releasing a simple demo soon.
						<br/>We provide a great opportunity to tell us about features you want, in an optional section in our sign up form. You can also just email us or tell me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">linkedin</a> anytime inspiration strikes!
					</p>
					<p>This is custom software, with the creator directly listening to customers, making sure that each customer has a system that fits their needs perfectly.
