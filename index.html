				<h2>TeaRounder for personal use:<br/>TeaRounder-Anywhere</h2>
				<p>Perfect for taking drink orders at home, in the office, or as a backup option for places with no ordering system.</p>
				<p>Just use the menu for common options and the custom item box for everything else, and you'll have a neat little list in your hand </p>

				<button onclick="location.href='anywhere/start.html'" type="button" class="homepageButton"><b>Start</b><br/>(free web page)</button>

				<h2>Looking to employ a developer?</h2>
				<p>This website and all the tools on it are built by Phil Ganney, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I live in the East of England and am looking for a new role.
				<p/>
				<p>You can contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-ganney-016a623a/">LinkedIn</a>
				</p>
				<p>You can see some of my code, for this and other projects at <a href="https://github.com/PhilGanney">github.com/PhilGanney</a></p>

			<div id="businessClosed" class="homepageSection odd">
				<h2>What happened with the cafe version?</h2>
				<p>Sadly I have stopped working on the cafe version, and have ceased trading. This is mostly due to financial reasons - at the price cafes would be willing to pay, I would need far more subscriptions to acheive a living wage than I feel possible in the time frame I needed. There are a bunch of factors that go into that decision including: cost of living going up rapidly and sales being harder than I had given credit for.</p>

			<div id="shoppingListerDescription" class="homepageSection even">
				<h2>ShoppingLister</h2>
				<p>A spin-off from TeaRounder-Anywhere, but for making shopping lists.</p>
				<p>Early prototype. If people like this concept, I can do some more work on it.</p>

				<button onclick="location.href='shoppingLister/start.html'" type="button" class="homepageButton">DEMO</button>
