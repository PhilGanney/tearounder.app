				<h2>TeaRounder at-table food and drink ordering app codebase acquired by Thinkable Cloud Ltd</h2>
				<p>Thinkable Cloud has been marketing TeaRounder for some time now, so when TeaRounder creator Phil Ganney decided to finish self-employment, it made sense to give the TeaRounder at-table food and drink ordering app a new lease of life in the hands of the Buckinghamshire based e-commerce and marketing business.
