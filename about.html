				So far:
			</h2>
			<p>
				This version is the first release, with the fundamental part of the vision for the app: a simple and sleek way to create a drinks list, with lots of popular drinks available to choose from, plus the ability to add other drinks to the list.
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<h2>
				Future updates:
			</h2>
			<p>
				Features planned for the next few releases: ability to set your own drinks selection, customizable colour scheme and fonts, dedicated option to note down who each drink is for (before this is added the best way to record this is in the additional notes for each drink line), ability to save and load drinks lists - useful when everyone wants their usual or the same again.
