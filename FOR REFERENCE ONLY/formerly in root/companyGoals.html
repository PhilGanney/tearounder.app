			<h1>Weekly goals and timesheets</h1>
			<p>I'm recording this, largely for my own benefit. I use it to keep structured, analyse my use of time and see how well I'm doing. </p>
			
			<p>I figure theres no harm in this being public, and some people might find it reassuring to know I have this structure.</p>
			
			<h2>Goals:7th - 13th Dec 2020</h2>
			<p>Get the business edition demo finished</p>
			<p>Email 10 target cafes, starting conversation toward them [hopefully] trying out TeaRounder [or at least get real prospective customer feedback] </p>
			<p>Connect blog and Social Media to website, and make sure they are up to date and have recent posts</p>

			<h2>Timesheet Friday 11th<h2>
			<p> First day keeping a timesheet when working on TeaRounder. My time recording process takes too long currently. I still like the idea of marking if each half hour block was productive, but this needs refinement. I shouldn't be spending a fifth of my time just recording my use of time! - Too detailed for something I do every half hour, and doing it as html makes it even slower - even if I do copy the tags across. It's tempting to use some of my JS code from the orders page, and make a timesheet page. Really tempting. I can see how it would come together and everything. I could probably make a really good start at it in an evening - I should really put that time towards rest or something directly to a current goal.</p>
